# Infrastructure for Python Script Development

## Documentation and script management 

All documentation will be on the Git repository and referenced on Sharepoint. 

Documentation will include: 

- Style guideline 

- List of all scripts, their names and functions, list of users 

- Development meeting notes and decisions 

- Tests for scripts

## Development Cycles 
Changes, updates and modifications of scripts will take place from Fall thru Spring quarters 
Summer quarter should be relatively quiet and used for reviewing scripts and thinking about modifications/planning.  
 
## Staging/Production Areas 
  
Production scripts should be on Github and clearly identified as the official versions 
A folder named “Staging” should be used for all scripts that are in development/testing 
 
## Development Process
The development process should involve two types of review: 

1. Review by another person doing scripting 

2. Testing and trial use by a stakeholder (someone who uses the script) 
 
## Feature/Bug reports  

A link will be provided to issue reporting in Github to provide a method for reporting bugs or feature requests. 
The reporter will rank the bug or feature request.  High priority bugs and feature requests will prompt immediate discussion. Lower priority bugs and feature requests will be reviewed at the start of each quarter.
